Google Chart

[Documentation for Google Column Chart](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/columnchart)

Added two Google charts on research page. The total renewable energy production for each year and the total renewable energy consumption for each year are both column charts. Column chart can show and compare the production vs consumption for each year clearly. I modified the column colors, lengend, vAxis and hAxis in option for each chart. The column chart is good to show the changes and comparison over years. Users can easily learn the trends for every year.
